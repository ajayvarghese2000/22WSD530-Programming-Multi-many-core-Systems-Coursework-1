 * @brief   This program multiplies two matrices. The program can then prints the
 *          result to the console if that option is selected. It use the simple 
 *          iterative algorithm to multiply the matrices. This program is a serial
 *          version of the program and therefore does not use any parallelism and 
 *          is limited to one thread. The values in the matrices are all intergers.
 *          
 *          First two matrices are created and then the values are assigned to
 *          the matrices. The matrices are then multiplied and the result is
 *          stored in a third matrix. The dimensions of the matrices are fixed and
 *          can be set in by passing in the required arguments.
